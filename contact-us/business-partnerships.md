## Farms and Syrup Pools 

Farms incentivize users to provide liquidity for your trading pair by distributing CAKE to your pair's LP Token holders.

Syrup Pools are a way of distributing your tokens to BSC users who stake CAKE in the pool.

These two products go hand-in-paw on PancakeSwap: when a project provides their tokens for a Syrup Pool, we'll also create a Farm. If you're looking to distribute tokens and incentivize liquidity, get in touch.

[**Apply to run a Syrup Pool**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScGdT5rrVMr4WOWr08pvcroSeuIOtEJf1sVdQGVdcAOqryigQ/viewform)\*\*\*\*

* Please don't email us to apply - we only respond to applications via the application form.
* Please don't chase us for a response on your application. We have a constant backlog of quality projects reaching out to us.

## IFOs \(Token Sales\)

"IFO" \(Initial Farm Offering\) is a new model of token sale pioneered by PancakeSwap. Here's how it works, in short:

* Users buy your token with CAKE-BNB LP tokens
* After the sale, we distribute the BNB to you and burn the CAKE.

Learn more about how IFOs work [here](../products/ifo-initial-farm-offering/ifo-initial-farm-offering.md).

## Listing on the Exchange

### How can I list my token on the exchange?

Anybody can "list" any BEP-20 network token on PancakeSwap. You don't need to contact us or ask permission. You just need to [add liquidity to a liquidity pool](../products/pancakeswap-exchange/pancakeswap-pools.md) - that's it. Traders can then trade your token by entering your token's contract address.

### How can I add my token to the default list?

You need to launch a Syrup Pool or IFO in order to be added to the list. See above.

We don't accept requests to add tokens to the approved list. 

### How can I add my token's logo/icon?

PancakeSwap's exchange references Trust Wallet's excellent assets collection for icons. Please add your icon here: [https://github.com/trustwallet/assets](https://github.com/trustwallet/assets)
