# Liquidity Pools

![](../../.gitbook/assets/docs-masthead-4-%20%281%29.png)

\*\*\*\*[**PancakeSwap Pools** ](https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/pool)allow you to provide liquidity by adding your tokens to Liquidity Pools.

When you add your token to a Liquidity Pool you will receive Liquidity Pool \(LP\) tokens and share in the fees.

## LP Tokens

As an example, if you deposited **CAKE** and **BNB** into a Liquidity Pool, you would receive **CAKE-BNB LP** tokens.

The number of LP tokens you receive represents your portion of the CAKE-BNB Liquidity Pool. 

You can also redeem your funds at any time by removing your liquidity.

Providing liquidity is not without risk, as you may be exposed to impermanent loss.  
[“Simply put, impermanent loss is the difference between holding tokens in an AMM and holding them in your wallet.” - Nate Hindman](https://blog.bancor.network/beginners-guide-to-getting-rekt-by-impermanent-loss-7c9510cb2f22)

## Earn from trading fees

It’s not all bad for liquidity providers as you will also be given a reward in the form of trading fees. Whenever someone trades PancakeSwap, the trader pays a 0.2% fee, of which 0.17% is added to the Liquidity Pool of the swap pair they traded on. 

For example:

* There are 10 LP tokens representing 10 CAKE and 10 BNB tokens.
* 1 LP token = 1 CAKE + 1 BNB
* Someone trades 10 CAKE for 10 BNB.
* Someone else trades 10 BNB for 10 CAKE.
* The CAKE/BNB liquidity pool now has 10.017 CAKE and 10.017 BNB.
* Each LP token is now worth 1.00017 CAKE + 1.00017 BNB.

To make being a liquidity provider even more worth your while, you can also put your LP tokens to work whipping up some fresh yield on the [CAKE Farms](https://pancakeswap.finance/farms), while still earning your 0.17% trading fee reward.
