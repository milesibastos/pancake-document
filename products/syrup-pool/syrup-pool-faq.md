# Syrup Pool FAQ & Troubleshooting

## Troubleshooting

### **I can't find the Syrup Pool I was staking in!**

You should be able to find the Syrup Pool under the “Finished” tab on the Syrup Pools page. 

By selecting “Staked Only”, it will make it easier to find your assets.

### **Why can’t I unstake my tokens from a Syrup Pool?**

If you are unable to unstake from the Stake Cake, Earn CAKE pools, please check to make sure that you haven’t sold the SYRUP tokens in your wallet. This token acts as a \`proof of ownership\` over your CAKE in the Manual CAKE pool. 

### **Why did my earned tokens go to zero after staking/unstaking?**

Don’t worry! They’re in your wallet already.

Whenever you stake or unstake from a Syrup Pool or farm, your earned tokens get harvested and sent to your wallet at the same time.

## **General Questions**

### **What does the “End” number on my Syrup Pool refer to?**

This shows the amount of blocks left until the rewards for that pool stop being distributed. Once the pool has reached that block, you should unstake your tokens, because you won’t be receiving any rewards after that.

### **Where do the rewards from Syrup Pools come from?**

There are currently two types of Syrup Pools

1. Stake CAKE, earn CAKE
2. Stake CAKE, earn other tokens. 

The rewards for the Stake CAKE, earn CAKE Syrup Pools come from the [CAKE emissions](https://docs.pancakeswap.finance/tokenomics/cake/cake-tokenomics). Each block, 10 CAKE tokens are allocated as rewards for these pools.

The rewards for the other Syrup Pools are provided by the project teams who sponsor a Syrup Pool.

### What’s SYRUP Token?

PancakeSwap’s SYRUP Token is deposited in your wallet when you interact with the **Manual** “Stake CAKE, Earn CAKE” Syrup Pool. It's not staked for 

It’s basically an IOU that shows how much CAKE you’ve staked in the pool.

It’ll be returned automatically when you unstake your CAKE from that pool.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Don’t sell your SYRUP tokens! You need to return your SYRUP to unstake your CAKE from the Manual CAKE pool. The amount of SYRUP you return must be the same as the amount of CAKE you unstake.
