Yield Farms allow users to earn CAKE while supporting PancakeSwap by staking LP Tokens.

Check out our [How to Use Farms guide](https://docs.pancakeswap.finance/products/yield-farming/how-to-use-farms) to get started with farming.

## Reward calculations

Yield Farm APR calculation includes both the rewards earned through providing liquidity and rewards earned staking LP Tokens in the Farm.

Previously, rewards earned by LP Token-holders generated from trading fees were not included in Farm APR calculations. APR calculations now include these rewards, and better reflect the expected APR for Farm pairs.

Below is a basic explanation of how APR is calculated.

In the image above of the WBNB/BUSD pair, we see these values:

**Liquidity:** $387.42M  
**Volume 24H:** $96.97M  
**Volume 7D:** 709.73M

To calculate the APR, first we take the 24hour volume, $96,970,000, and calculate the fee-share of LP-holders, 0.17% \[**$96,970,000\*0.17/100 = $164,849\]**.

Next, we estimate the yearly fees based on the 24h volume \[**$164,849\*365 = $60,169,885**\].

Now we can calculate the fee APR with yearly fees divided by liquidity \[\(**$60,169,885/$387,420,000\)\*100 = 15.53%**\]

With the fee APR, we can add the fee APR \(15.53%\) and the Farm staking APR \(20.08%\) to get the new total APR \[**15.53%+20.08% = 35.61%**\].
